98% of my code snippets/edit/scripts may contain sensitive information/keys. I have hundreds of text files containing codes. 
Also, when I create something that doesnt exists (using other pieces of codes, I'm not Houdini), I generally keep it private. 
Examples of this can be found in my resume. 
It includes crawlbots, auction sites posting/reposting, push-notification services such as pusher/pushbullet/pushover & many many many scripts doing various things. 
I am not an academically gifted programmer and I probably cannot answer fairly basic coding questions on top of my head**
Then again, documentation and support will generally be enough for anything I don't understand. 
If that fails, I personally know many talented programmers and have a fairly reputable StackOverflow and StackSecurity account.

**I have not had any real programming classes. 
Only documentations and bothering support people for 10 years.
